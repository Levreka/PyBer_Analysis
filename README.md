# PyBer_Analysis

Overview: the purpose is to use python and pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing-data by city type. Followed by a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. 


Results:

Looking at the results from sharing-data by city type. We see that the type of residential area does play a role in total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per drivers. As expected urban areas have the highest number of rides, drivers total fares. Followed by suburban and lastly rural. The other important observation is that although urban areas bring the most money to the company, they tend to be the least profitable for drivers. We see that average fare per driver in rural areas is an astonishing 55.49 which is over 3 times what the average driver makes in urban areas. The simplest explanation for this is the idea of supply and demand urban areas total drivers dwarfs both rural and suburban areas combine. Which creates huge supply and less demand.

The graph from jan to april by city type shares some of the same pattern as our data frame. Observing it we again see urban cities bring higher fare numbers. They also seem to have the most frequent spikes in fare prices. 

Summary: our first recommendation is regarding drivers' average fares, there seems to be a large disproportion between rural and urban drivers. It is important to gather more data to see if this is due to supply and demand or if there is another factor that is playing into this. Providing incentives to urban drivers or some kind of bonus programs so that urban drivers don't fall so far behind rural drivers. Finally using the graph we can actually set those extra bonus for urban drivers since we can see the spikes in our fare by city and we can align them to when the company receive the most income.
